# Digital Control Systems Labs (Master’s ESE)

Welcome to the **Digital Control Systems Labs** repository from USTO-MB’s Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Department of Electronics.  
This mono-repo contains two progressive lab exercises in MATLAB and Simulink, forming a unified hands-on journey through digital control theory and signal processing.

## 📚 Course Overview

In these two labs, you will:

1. **Lab 1:**  
   – Define, analyze, and simulate a continuous-time transfer function using MATLAB’s Control System Toolbox.  
   – Plot step and impulse responses with proper labels and grids.  
   – Reproduce the system in Simulink and observe its open-loop response.

2. **Lab 2:**  
   – Generate, sample, and hold discrete signals (Dirac impulses and combs) in MATLAB.  
   – Work with continuous signals (e.g. \(y(t)=\sin t\)): sample, zero-order-hold, and compare.  
   – Explore the effect of different sampling periods.  
   – Build equivalent models in Simulink (including Zero-Order Hold blocks) and visualize the discrete-time responses.

Each lab builds directly on the previous, reinforcing concepts of control loops and signal processing in embedded applications.
